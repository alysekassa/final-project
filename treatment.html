				<h1>Treatment
				</h1>
				<p>Children with osteosarcoma are treated with intensive chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and to prevent new tumors from forming. Standard chemotherapy medications for osteosarcoma include cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate. Our doctors led a pilot study showing that giving the drug dexrazoxane to patients with newly diagnosed osteogenic sarcoma can help protect damage to the heart, which can occur as a result of treatment with doxorubicin.</p>
				<p>Once osteosarcoma is found and staged, the cancer care team will talk with you about treatment options. It is important to take time and think about your options. Because osteosarcoma is rare, only doctors in major cancer centers have a lot of experience treating these cancers.</p>
				<p>For children, a team approach is recommended that includes the child&rsquo;s pediatrician as well as children&rsquo;s cancer specialists. Treatment is best done at a children&rsquo;s cancer center. For adults with osteosarcoma, the treatment team typically includes the patient&rsquo;s primary care doctor, as well as specialists at a major cancer center. Doctors on the treatment team might include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An orthopedic surgeon (a surgeon who specializes in muscles and bones) experienced in treating bone tumors</li>
					<li>A medical or pediatric oncologist (a doctor trained to treat cancer with chemotherapy and other drugs)</li>
					<li>A radiation oncologist (a doctor trained to treat cancer with radiation therapy)</li>
					<li>A pathologist (a doctor specializing in lab tests to diagnose and classify diseases)</li>
					<li>A rehabilitation/physical therapy expert</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For both adults and children, the team would also include other doctors, nurses, rehabilitation therapists, and technologists who have essential roles in diagnosing and treating the disease and assisting in recovery after surgery.</p>
				<p>The types of treatment used for osteosarcomas include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="surgery.html" target="_top">Surgery</a></li>
					<li><a href="chemotherapy.html" target="_top">Chemotherapy</a></li>
					<li><a href="radiation-therapy.html" target="_top">Radiation therapy</a>Â (in certain cases)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In most cases, both chemotherapy and surgery are needed.</p>
