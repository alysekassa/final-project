				<p>I met Ryann Wenke first semester of freshmen year and since  then I have learned more about putting things in perspective than I&rsquo;ve ever  learned from anyone before. At first glance you would have no idea she has  survived cancer (twice). She goes through her days as a normal college student  would but looming behind her are her years spent in hospital beds, her  treatment, and her surgeries. As a normal freshmen in high school she began to  feel pain in her left knee. After a few doctor visits, imaging tests, and a  biopsy it was confirmed on May 8th, 2008 that she had osteosarcoma. She  put her entire life on hold for nine months and began treatment at Mt. Sinai  right away. Throughout these nine months she experienced the worst pain of her  life, lost all her hair because of the chemotherapy and almost lost her leg. Her  eight hour surgery to take the tumor out of her knee was successful, but she had  months of physical therapy ahead of her so she could walk again. Her surgeon completely replaced her knee with an internal metal prostethic to save her leg from amputation. Ryann and her  friends and family thought she had completely fought her cancer until she was  diagnosed again in September of 2010. As seen with many patients, the  osteosarcoma cells metastasized in her lungs as a nodule and she needed  treatment again before it became an actual tumor. Five months more of  chemotherapy and she was finally cancer free again.</p>
<p>While regular high school seniors  were trying to apply to colleges, take SATs, and worry about who their prom  dates were going to be, Ryann was fighting cancer for the second time. Looking  back at my high school days I could never imagine fighting against what she did.  My biggest worries back then were my best friend bought the same color prom  dress as me and my series of less than great relationships with less than great  boyfriends. We all hear this too often, but things could really be so much  worse. I admire Ryann in every single aspect. Her courage and bravery while  fighting off cancer, the courage she had while having to wear a wig, and the  courage she had to move on with her lift. That part of her life is behind her  and that&rsquo;s how she intends it to always stay. Even now, when I feel like I&rsquo;m  having an awful day and I just want to curl up in bed and never leave, I think  of how completely lucky I am to have even been able to have a bad day. Potentially,  Ryann could have never seen a bad day again, or any day for that matter. Feeling  lucky just to be alive is one of the best feelings and Ryann has put that into  perspective for me. I wish I could thank her a hundred times over, but I&rsquo;ll  never be able to express in words my gratitude for what she has taught me. If  Ryann and the hundreds of thousands of other cancer survivors don&rsquo;t motivate  you to have courage, I&rsquo;m not sure what will</p>
