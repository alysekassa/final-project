				<h1>Key Statistics
				and Survival Rates</h1>
				<p> For key statistics and survival rates data was collected over a wide range of years. If studying the survival rate for a five year period,	the	osteosarcoma	patient would have been initially treated over five years previously. With advances in technology and research happening so rapidly, we can only hope these statistics for current patients are improving every year, leading to more survivors than ever seen before.</p>
				<p>Osteosarcoma is not a common  cancer. Each year, about 800 new cases of osteosarcoma are diagnosed in the United States.  About 400 of these are in children and teens.</p>
				<p>With modern treatment, the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized osteosarcoma is in the range of 60% to 80%. These cancers are more likely to be cured if they are resectable, meaning, when all of the visible tumor can be completely removed (resected) by surgery. (For high-grade osteosarcomas that can be completely resected, chemotherapy is still an essential part of treatment. Without it, the cancer is still very likely to come back.)</p>
				<p>If metastases are present when the osteosarcoma is first diagnosed, the 5-year survival rate is about 15% to 30%. The survival rate is closer to 40% if the cancer has spread only to the lungs (as opposed to having reached other organs), or if all of the tumors (including metastases) can be removed with surgery.</p>
