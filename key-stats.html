				<h1>Key Statistics
				and Survival Rates</h1>
				<p>Osteosarcoma is not a common  cancer. Each year, about 800 new cases of osteosarcoma are diagnosed in the United States.  About 400 of these are in children and teens.</p>
				<p>With modern treatment, the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized osteosarcoma is in the range of 60% to 80%. These cancers are more likely to be cured if they are resectable, that is, when all of the visible tumor can be completely removed (resected) by surgery. (For high-grade osteosarcomas that can be completely resected, chemotherapy is still an essential part of treatment. Without it, the cancer is still very likely to come back.)</p>
				<p>If metastases are present when the osteosarcoma is first diagnosed, the 5-year survival rate is about 15% to 30%. The survival rate is closer to 40% if the cancer has spread only to the lungs (as opposed to having reached other organs), or if all of the tumors (including metastases) can be removed with surgery.</p>
