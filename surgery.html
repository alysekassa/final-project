				<h1>Surgery</h1>
				<p>Surgery for osteosarcoma includes both the biopsy to diagnose the cancer and the surgical treatment. Surgery is an important part of treatment for virtually all osteosarcomas.</p>
				<p><em>Whenever possible, it is very important that the biopsy and surgical treatment be planned together, and that the same orthopedic surgeon at a cancer center does both the biopsy and the surgical treatment.</em></p>
				<p>The main goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer. If even a few cancer cells are left behind, they can grow and multiply to make a new tumor. To try to be sure that this doesn&rsquo;t happen, surgeons remove the tumor plus some of the normal tissue that surrounds it. This is known as <em>wide excision</em>. Removing some normal-looking tissue around the tumor raises the chance that all of the cancer is removed.</p>
				<p>A pathologist will look at the removed tissue under a microscope to see if the margins (outer edges) contain cancer cells. If cancer cells are seen at the edges of the tissue, the margins are called <em>positive</em>. Positive margins can mean that some cancer was left behind. When no cancer cells are seen at the edges of the tissue, the margins are said to be <em>negative</em>, <em>clean</em>, or <em>clear</em>. A wide excision with clean margins minimizes the risk that the cancer will grow back where it started.</p>
				<p>The type of surgery done depends on the location of the tumor. Although all operations to remove osteosarcomas are complex, tumors in the limbs (arms or legs) are generally not as hard to remove as those at the base of the skull, in the spine, or in the pelvis.	</p>
