				<h1>Symptoms and Signs
				</h1>
				<h3>Pain and swelling</h3>
				<p>Pain in the affected bone (usually around the knee or in the upper arm) is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma. At first, the pain might not be constant and may be worse at night. The pain often increases with activity and may result in a limp if the tumor is in a leg.</p>
				<p>Swelling in the area is the next most common symptom, although it may not occur until several weeks after the pain starts. Depending on where the tumor is, it may be possible to feel a lump or mass.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, limb pain and/or swelling are very common in normal, active children and teens, and might not prompt a doctor visit right away. This can delay a diagnosis. These symptoms are less common in adults and should be a sign to see a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
				<h3>Bone fractures (breaks)</h3>
				<p>Although osteosarcoma might weaken the bone it develops in, the bones often do not break. Telangiectatic osteosarcomas, which are rare, tend to weaken bones more than other forms of osteosarcoma and are more likely to cause a fracture at the tumor site.</p>
				<p>People with a fracture next to or through an osteosarcoma often describe a limb that was sore for a few months and suddenly became very painful when the fracture occurred.</p>
