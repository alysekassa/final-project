				<h1>Chemotherapy
				</h1>
				<p>Chemotherapy (chemo) is the use of drugs for treating cancer, which are usually given into a vein or artery. The drugs enter the bloodstream and reach and destroy cancer cells throughout the body.</p>
				<p>In many cases, osteosarcoma has spread to the lungs and/or other organs or has a high risk of doing so, even if tumors can&rsquo;t be seen on imaging tests. Because of this, chemotherapy is an important part of the treatment for most osteosarcomas, although some patients with low-grade osteosarcoma may not need it.</p>
				<p>Doctors give chemotherapy in cycles, with each period of treatment followed by a rest period to allow the body time to recover. Each cycle typically lasts for a few weeks.</p>
				<p>Most osteosarcomas are treated with chemotherapy given before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) for about 10 weeks and again after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy) for up to a year. People with high-grade osteosarcomas that responded well to chemo before surgery usually get the same chemo after surgery. People whose tumors responded poorly usually will get different chemo after surgery.</p>
