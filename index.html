				<h1>About Osteosarcoma</h1>
				<p>Osteosarcoma is the  most common type of cancer that develops in bone. Like the osteoblasts in  normal bone, the cells that form this cancer make bone matrix. But the bone  matrix of an osteosarcoma is not as strong as that of normal bones. <br />
					Most osteosarcomas occur in children and young adults. Teens are  the most commonly affected age group, but osteosarcoma can occur at any age. <br />
				In children and young adults, osteosarcoma usually develops in  areas where the bone is growing quickly, such as near the ends of the long  bones. Most tumors develop in the bones around the knee, either in the distal  femur (the lower part of the thigh bone) or the proximal tibia (the upper part  of the shinbone). The proximal humerus (the part of the upper arm bone close to  the shoulder) is the next most common site. However, osteosarcoma can develop  in any bone, including the bones of the pelvis (hips), shoulder, and jaw. This  is especially true in older adults. It can spread to other areas of the body,  including lungs, bone and – much less commonly – kidneys, the adrenal gland,  the brain, and the heart.</p>
