				<h1>Biopsy</h1>
				<p>Although the results of imaging tests may strongly suggest that a person has some type of bone cancer, a biopsy (removing some of the tumor for viewing under a microscope and other lab testing) is the only way to be certain. A biopsy is also the best way to tell osteosarcoma from other types of cancer.</p>
				<p><em>If the tumor is in a bone, it is very important that a surgeon experienced in treating bone tumors does the biopsy.</em>Whenever possible, the biopsy and surgical treatment should be planned together, and the same orthopedic surgeon should do both the biopsy and the surgery. Proper planning of the biopsy location and technique can prevent later complications and reduce the amount of surgery needed later on.</p>
				<p>There are 2 main types of biopsies.</p>
				<h3>Needle biopsy</h3>
				<p>For these biopsies, the doctor uses a hollow needle to remove a small sample of the tumor. The biopsy is usually done with local anesthesia, where numbing medicine is injected into the tissue over the biopsy site. In some cases, sedation or general anesthesia (where the patient is asleep) may be needed.</p>
				<p>Often, the doctor can aim the needle by feeling the suspicious area if it is near the surface of the body. If the tumor cannot be felt because it is too deep, the doctor can guide the needle while viewing a CT scan. This is called a <em>CT guided needle biopsy</em>.</p>
				<p><strong>Core needle biopsy:</strong> In a core needle biopsy, the doctor uses a large, hollow needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the tumor.</p>
				<p><strong>Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy:</strong> For an FNA biopsy, the doctor uses a very thin needle attached to a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) a small amount of fluid and some cells from the tumor. This type of biopsy is rarely used for bone tumors.</p>
				<h3>Surgical (open) biopsy</h3>
				<p>In an open biopsy, the surgeon cuts through the skin, exposes the tumor, and then cuts out a piece of it. These biopsies are usually done under general anesthesia (with the patient asleep). They can also be done using a nerve block, which makes a large area numb.</p>
				<p>This type of biopsy must be done by an expert in bone tumors. Otherwise it could result in problems later on. For example, if the tumor is on the arm or leg, it&rsquo;s possible the chance for saving the limb may be lost. If possible, the opening through the skin used in the biopsy should be lengthwise along the arm or leg because this is the way the incision will be made for the operation to remove the cancer. The entire scar of the original biopsy will also have to be removed, so making the biopsy incision this way lessens the amount of tissue that needs to be removed later on.</p>
