				<h1>Imaging tests</h1>
				<p>Imaging tests use x-rays, magnetic fields, or radioactive substances to create pictures of the inside of the body. Imaging tests may be done for a number of reasons, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To help find out if a suspicious area might be cancer</li>
					<li>To help determine if a cancer may have started in another part of the body</li>
					<li>To learn how far cancer may have spread</li>
					<li>To help determine if treatment has been effective</li>
					<li>To look for signs that the cancer may have come back</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Patients who have or may have osteosarcoma will have one or more of these tests.</p>
				<h3>Bone x-ray</h3>
				<p>Doctors can often recognize or at least suspect osteosarcoma on plain x-rays of the bone. But other imaging tests may be needed as well.</p>
				<p>Even if results of an x-ray strongly suggest a person has osteosarcoma, a biopsy will still be needed to confirm that it is cancer rather than some other problem, such as an infection.</p>
				<h3>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</h3>
				<p>MRI scans provide detailed images of soft tissues in the body. These scans use radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays, so no radiation is involved. The energy from the radio waves is absorbed by the body and then released in a pattern formed by the type of body tissue and by certain diseases. A computer translates the pattern into a very detailed image of parts of the body. A contrast material called <em>gadolinium</em> may be injected into a vein before the scan to better see details.</p>
				<p>Often, an MRI scan is done to better define a bone mass seen on an x-ray. MRI scans can usually tell if the mass is likely to be a tumor, an infection, or some type of bone damage from other causes. MRI scans can also help show the exact extent of a tumor, as they provide a detailed view of the marrow inside bones and the soft tissues around the tumor. Sometimes, the MRI can help find small bone tumors several inches away from the main tumor (called <em>skip metastases</em>). Defining the extent of an osteosarcoma is very important when planning surgery. An MRI scan usually gives better details than a CT scan (described below).</p>
				<p>Having an MRI scan can take up to an hour. You (or your child) may have to lie on a table that slides inside a narrow tube, which is confining and can be distressing. The newer, more open MRI machines can help with these feelings, but the test still requires staying still for long periods of time. The machines also make buzzing and clicking noises that may be disturbing. Sometimes, younger children are given medicine to help keep them calm or even sleep during the test.</p>
				<h3>Computed tomography (CT) scan</h3>
				<p>The CT scan uses x-rays to produce detailed cross-sectional images of parts of the body. Instead of taking one picture, like a regular x-ray, a CT scanner takes many pictures as it rotates around a person lying on a table. A computer then combines these pictures into images of slices of the part of the body being studied. Unlike a regular x-ray, a CT scan creates detailed images of the soft tissues in the body.</p>
				<p>Before the test, you (or your child) may be asked to drink a contrast solution and/or get an intravenous (IV) injection of a contrast dye that helps better outline abnormal areas in the body. If the contrast dye is to be injected, you (or your child) may need an IV line. The contrast may cause some flushing (a feeling of warmth, especially in the face). Some people are allergic and get hives. Rarely, more serious reactions like trouble breathing or low blood pressure can occur. Be sure to tell the doctor if you (or your child) have any allergies or have ever had a reaction to any contrast material used for x-rays.</p>
				<p>A CT scanner has been described as a large donut, with a narrow table in the middle opening. During the test, the table slides in and out of the scanner. You (or your child) will need to lie still on the table while the scan is being done. CT scans take longer than regular x-rays, and you might feel a bit confined by the ring while the pictures are being taken. In some cases, children may need to be sedated before the test to stay still and help make sure the pictures come out well.</p>
				<p>CT scans are sometimes used to look at the affected bone to see if the tumor has grown into nearby muscle, fat, or tendons, although MRI is often better for this. A CT scan of the chest is often done to look for spread of the cancer to the lungs.</p>
				<h3>Chest x-ray</h3>
				<p>This test is sometimes done to see if cancer has spread to the lungs. It can find larger tumors, but it is not as good as a CT scan for spotting smaller tumors. If a CT scan of the chest is done, a chest x-ray may not be needed.</p>
				<h3>Bone scan</h3>
				<p>A bone scan can help show if a cancer has spread to other bones, and is often part of the workup for people with osteosarcoma. This test is useful because it provides a picture of the entire skeleton at once.</p>
				<p>For this test, a small amount of low-level radioactive material is injected into a vein (intravenously, or IV). The substance settles in areas of damaged bone throughout the entire skeleton over the course of a couple of hours. You (or your child) then lie on a table for about 30 minutes while a special camera detects the radioactivity and creates a picture of the skeleton. Younger children may be given medicine to help keep them calm or even asleep during the test.</p>
				<p>Areas of active bone changes appear as &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; on the skeleton because they attract the radioactivity. Hot spots may suggest areas of cancer, but other bone diseases can also cause the same pattern. To make an accurate diagnosis, other imaging tests such as plain x-rays, MRI scans, or even a bone biopsy might be needed.</p>
				<h3>Positron emission tomography (PET) scan</h3>
				<p>For aPET scan, a radioactive substance (usually a type of sugar related to glucose, known as <em>FDG</em>) is injected into the blood. The amount of radioactivity used is very low. Because cancer cells in the body are growing quickly, they absorb large amounts of the radioactive sugar. After about an hour, you (or your child) will lie on a table in the PET scanner for about 30 minutes while a special camera creates a picture of areas of radioactivity in the body. The picture is not finely detailed like a CT or MRI scan, but it provides useful information about the whole body.</p>
				<p>PET scans can help show the spread of osteosarcomas to the lungs, other bones, or other parts of the body, and can also help in following the response to treatment.</p>
				<p>Some newer machines can do a PET and CT scan at the same time (PET/CT scan). This lets the doctor compare areas of higher radioactivity on the PET with the more detailed appearance of that area on the CT.</p>
